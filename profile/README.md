## Hi there 👋

Aurabox is a cloud-based, medical imaging storage and viewing platform which allows doctors to access a patient’s entire imaging history on one platform, regardless of where imaging was obtained.

Aurabox is for patients and doctors. We believe empowering patients by giving them easy access to their medical imaging engages them in the management of their health, and in doing so allows doctors to efficiently assess patients, collaborate on care, and monitor treatment outcomes.
